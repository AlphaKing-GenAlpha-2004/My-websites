    <h1>Korean War</h1>
    <h2><em>1950-1953</em></h2>
    <p>
      Korean War, conflict between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
      (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in which at least
      2.5 million persons lost their lives. The war reached international
      proportions in June 1950 when North Korea, supplied and advised by the
      Soviet Union, invaded the South. The United Nations, with the United
      States as the principal participant, joined the war on the side of the
      South Koreans, and the People’s Republic of China came to North Korea’s
      aid. After more than a million combat casualties had been suffered on both
      sides, the fighting ended in July 1953 with Korea still divided into two
      hostile states. Negotiations in 1954 produced no further agreement, and
      the front line has been accepted ever since as the de facto boundary
      between North and South Korea.
    </p>
    <h2>Revolution, division, and partisan warfare, 1945–50</h2>
    <p>
      The Korean War had its immediate origins in the collapse of the Japanese
      empire at the end of World War II in September 1945. Unlike China,
      Manchuria, and the former Western colonies seized by Japan in 1941–42,
      Korea, annexed to Japan since 1910, did not have a native government or a
      colonial regime waiting to return after hostilities ceased. Most claimants
      to power were harried exiles in China, Manchuria, Japan, the U.S.S.R., and
      the United States. They fell into two broad categories. The first was made
      up of committed Marxist revolutionaries who had fought the Japanese as
      part of the Chinese-dominated guerrilla armies in Manchuria and China. One
      of these exiles was a minor but successful guerrilla leader named Kim
      Il-sung, who had received some training in Russia and had been made a
      major in the Soviet army. The other Korean nationalist movement, no less
      revolutionary, drew its inspiration from the best of science, education,
      and industrialism in Europe, Japan, and America. These “ultranationalists”
      were split into rival factions, one of which centred on Syngman Rhee,
      educated in the United States and at one time the president of a dissident
      Korean Provisional Government in exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their hurried effort to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the
      Japanese population in Korea (estimated at 700,000), the United States and
      the Soviet Union agreed in August 1945 to divide the country for
      administrative purposes at the 38th parallel (latitude 38° N). At least
      from the American perspective, this geographic division was a temporary
      expedient; however, the Soviets began a short-lived reign of terror in
      northern Korea that quickly politicized the division by driving thousands
      of refugees south. The two sides could not agree on a formula that would
      produce a unified Korea, and in 1947 U.S. President Harry S. Truman
      persuaded the United Nations (UN) to assume responsibility for the
      country, though the U.S. military remained nominally in control of the
      South until 1948. Both the South Korean national police and the
      constabulary doubled in size, providing a southern security force of about
      80,000 by 1947. In the meantime, Kim Il-sung strengthened his control over
      the Communist Party as well as the northern administrative structure and
      military forces. In 1948 the North Korean military and police numbered
      about 100,000, reinforced by a group of southern Korean guerrillas based
      at Haeju in western Korea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of an independent South Korea became UN policy in early 1948.
      Southern communists opposed this, and by autumn partisan warfare had
      engulfed parts of every Korean province below the 38th parallel. The
      fighting expanded into a limited border war between the South’s newly
      formed Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and the North Korean border
      constabulary as well as the North’s Korean People’s Army (KPA). The North
      launched 10 cross-border guerrilla incursions in order to draw ROKA units
      away from their guerrilla-suppression campaign in the South. In its larger
      purpose the partisan uprising failed: the Republic of Korea (ROK) was
      formed in August 1948, with Syngman Rhee as president. Nevertheless,
      almost 8,000 members of the South Korean security forces and at least
      30,000 other Koreans lost their lives. Many of the victims were not
      security forces or armed guerrillas at all but simply people identified as
      “rightists” or “reds” by the belligerents. Small-scale atrocities became a
      way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partisan war also delayed the training of the South Korean army. In
      early 1950, American advisers judged that fewer than half of the ROKA’s
      infantry battalions were even marginally ready for war. U.S. military
      assistance consisted largely of surplus light weapons and supplies.
      Indeed, General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the United States’ Far
      East Command (FECOM), argued that his Eighth Army, consisting of four weak
      divisions in Japan, required more support than the Koreans.
    </p>
    <h2>Invasion and counterinvasion, 1950–51</h2>
    <h3>South to Pusan</h3>
    <p>
      In early 1949 Kim Il-sung pressed his case with Soviet leader Joseph
      Stalin that the time had come for a conventional invasion of the South.
      Stalin refused, concerned about the relative unpreparedness of the North
      Korean armed forces and about possible U.S. involvement. In the course of
      the next year, the communist leadership built the KPA into a formidable
      offensive force modeled after a Soviet mechanized army. The Chinese
      released Korean veterans from the People’s Liberation Army, while the
      Soviets provided armaments. By 1950 the North Koreans enjoyed substantial
      advantages over the South in every category of equipment. After another
      Kim visit to Moscow in March–April 1950, Stalin approved an invasion. In
      the predawn hours of June 25, the North Koreans struck across the 38th
      parallel behind a thunderous artillery barrage. The principal offensive,
      conducted by the KPA I Corps (53,000 men), drove across the Imjin River
      toward Seoul. The II Corps (54,000 soldiers) attacked along two widely
      separated axes, one through the cities of Ch’unch’ŏn and Inje to Hongch’ŏn
      and the other down the east coast road toward Kangnŭng. The KPA entered
      Seoul in the afternoon of June 28, but the North Koreans did not
      accomplish their goal of a quick surrender by the Rhee government and the
      disintegration of the South Korean army. Instead, remnants of the
      Seoul-area ROKA forces formed a defensive line south of the Han River, and
      on the east coast road ROKA units gave ground in good order. Still, if the
      South was to stave off collapse, it would need help—from the U.S. armed
      forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truman’s initial response was to order MacArthur to transfer munitions to
      the ROKA and to use air cover to protect the evacuation of U.S. citizens.
      Instead of pressing for a congressional declaration of war, which he
      regarded as too alarmist and time-consuming when time was of the essence,
      Truman went to the United Nations for sanction. Under U.S. guidance, the
      UN called for the invasion to halt (June 25), then for the UN member
      states to provide military assistance to the ROK (June 27). By charter the
      Security Council considered and passed the resolutions, which could have
      been vetoed by a permanent member such as the Soviet Union. The Soviets,
      however, were boycotting the Council over the issue of admitting communist
      China to the UN. Congressional and public opinion in the United States,
      meanwhile, supported military intervention without significant dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having demonstrated its political will, the Truman administration faced
      the unhappy truth that it did not have much effective military power to
      meet the invasion. MacArthur secured the commitment of three divisions
      from Japan, but U.S. ground forces only expanded the scope of defeat. For
      almost eight weeks, near Osan, along the Kum River, through Taejŏn, and
      south to Taegu, U.S. soldiers fought and died—and some fled. Weakened by
      inadequate weapons, limited numbers, and uncertain leadership, U.S. troops
      were frequently beset by streams of refugees fleeing south, which
      increased the threat of guerrilla infiltration. These conditions produced
      horrifying attacks on Korean civilians. From late June to mid-July, South
      Korean paramilitary forces massacred thousands of civilians at Taejŏn, a
      war crime that was attributed to the North Koreans by South Korean and
      U.S. authorities for half a century. During the last week in July, U.S.
      troops and aircraft fired on refugees at a railroad viaduct near the
      hamlet of Nogun-ri, west of the Naktong River, killing hundreds. It was
      not until the first weeks of August that the United Nations Command, or
      UNC, as MacArthur’s theatre forces had been redesignated, started to slow
      the North Koreans. The Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Walton
      H. Walker, one of the best corps commanders in Europe in 1944–45, and the
      ROKA, led by Major General Chung Il-kwon, rallied and fought back with
      more success. Supplies came through the port at Pusan, where the Eighth
      Army’s logistics system depended on Korean and Japanese technicians and on
      thousands of Korean labourers. To stop the North Koreans’ tanks and
      supporting artillery and infantry, Walker brought in Sherman and Pershing
      medium tanks, rocket launchers, artillery pieces, antiaircraft guns, and,
      most important of all, close-air-support aircraft. The Fifth Air Force
      attacked forward units of the KPA with World War II-era P-51 Mustangs, new
      jet-powered F-80s and F-84s, and even B-26 and B-29 bombers. U.S. Marine
      Corps squadrons, embarked on navy light carriers, were capable of flying
      anywhere along the front in quick response to requests from ground forces,
      and on the east coast the U.S. Navy’s cruisers and destroyers became a
      seagoing heavy artillery for the ROK I Corps. Meanwhile, fresh U.S. Army
      and Marine Corps units began to arrive, supplemented by a British
      Commonwealth brigade. In the same period, the ROKA, which had shrunk to
      half its prewar strength through deaths, surrenders, a few defections, and
      substantial desertions, began to bring its ranks back up with reservists,
      student volunteers, and men impressed from cities’ streets as the South
      Koreans fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerned that the shift of combat power toward the UNC would continue
      into September, the field commander of the KPA, General Kim Chaek, ordered
      an advance against the Naktong River–Taegu–Yŏngdŏk line, soon to become
      famous as the “Pusan Perimeter.” The major effort was a double envelopment
      of Taegu, supplemented by drives toward Masan and P’ohang, the
      southwestern and northeastern coastal anchors of the perimeter. None
      reached significant objectives. At the Battle of Tabu-dong (August 18–26),
      the ROK 1st Division and the U.S. 27th Regimental Combat Team defeated the
      North Koreans’ main armoured thrust toward Taegu. By September 12 the KPA,
      its two corps reduced to 60,000 men and its tank forces destroyed, had
      been driven back in most places west of the Naktong and well away from
      Taegu and P’ohang. At that moment the entire strategic balance of the war
      was shifted by the sudden appearance of the X Corps at Inch’ŏn.
    </p>
    <h3>North to the Yalu</h3>
    <p>
      MacArthur did not believe that he could win the war without an amphibious
      landing deep behind enemy lines, and he had started to think about a
      landing as early as July. For the core of his landing force, he and the
      Joint Chiefs of Staff selected the 1st Marine Division and the Eighth
      Army’s remaining infantry division, the 7th. As the force developed, it
      also included South Korean marine and infantry units and an assortment of
      U.S. support troops. The entire force was designated X Corps and was
      commanded by Major General Edward M. Almond, MacArthur’s chief of staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the landing site, MacArthur himself fixed on Inch’ŏn, the port outlet
      of Seoul on Korea’s west coast. A host of problems defied a landing there:
      wide tidal variance, mines, a crazy quilt of islands and shoal waters, and
      dangerous proximity to KPA reinforcements from Seoul. MacArthur brushed
      off all these concerns. After a naval gun and aerial bombardment on
      September 14, marines the next day assaulted a key harbour defense site,
      Wŏlmi Island, and then in the late afternoon took Inch’ŏn itself. The
      North Korean resistance was stubborn but spread thin, and the 1st Marine
      Division, accompanied by ROK and U.S. army units, entered Seoul on
      September 25. The bulk of the 7th Division advanced to Suwŏn, where it
      contacted the Eighth Army on the 26th. MacArthur and Syngman Rhee marched
      into the damaged capitol building and declared South Korea liberated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an organized field force, the KPA disintegrated, having lost 13,000 as
      prisoners and 50,000 as casualties in August and September. Nevertheless,
      about 25,000 of its best troops took to the mountains and marched home as
      cohesive units; another 10,000 remained in South Korea as partisans. As
      the communists headed north, they took thousands of South Koreans with
      them as hostages and enslaved labourers and left additional thousands
      executed in their wake. At Taejŏn more than 1,500 people, including
      civilians and U.S. and South Korean prisoners of war, were massacred, in
      apparent retaliation for the earlier mass killings by South Korean troops.
      The ROK army and national police, for their part, showed little sympathy
      to any southern communists they found or suspected, and U.S. aircraft
      attacked people and places with little restraint. As a result, the last
      two weeks of September saw atrocities rivaling those seen in Europe during
      the fratricidal Thirty Years’ War of the 17th century. Even before the
      Inch’ŏn landing, MacArthur had thought ahead to a campaign into North
      Korea, though his plans never went beyond establishing a line across the
      so-called waist of Korea, from P’yŏngyang in the west to Wŏnsan in the
      east. On September 27 the Joint Chiefs gave him final authority to conduct
      operations north of the 38th parallel; however, he was instructed to limit
      operations in the event of Russian or Chinese intervention. For the UNC
      the war aim was expanded. As announced by the UN General Assembly on
      October 7, it was to include the occupation of all of North Korea and the
      elimination of the KPA as a threat to the political reconstruction of
      Korea as one nation. To that end, ROKA units crossed the parallel on
      October 1, and U.S. Army units crossed on October 7. The ROK I Corps
      marched rapidly up the east coast highway, winning the race for Wŏnsan;
      P’yŏngyang fell to the U.S. I Corps on October 19. The Kim Il-sung
      government, with the remnants of nine KPA divisions, fell back to the
      mountain town of Kanggye. Two other divisions, accompanied by Soviet
      advisers and air defense forces, struggled northwest toward the Yalu River
      and the Chinese border at Sinŭiju. The UNC assumed that the KPA had lost
      its will to fight. In reality, it was awaiting rescue.
    </p>
    <h3>Back to the 38th parallel</h3>
    <p>
      As UNC troops crossed the 38th parallel, Chinese Communist Party Chairman
      Mao Zedong received a plea for direct military aid from Kim Il-sung. The
      chairman was willing to intervene, but he needed assurances of Soviet air
      power. Stalin promised to extend China’s air defenses (manned by Soviets)
      to a corridor above the Yalu, thus protecting air bases in Manchuria and
      hydroelectric plants on the river, and he also promised new Soviet weapons
      and armaments factories. After much debate, Mao ordered the Renmin
      Zhiyuanjun, or Chinese People’s Volunteers Force (CPVF), to cross into
      Korea. It was commanded by General Peng Dehuai, a veteran of 20 years of
      war against the Chinese Nationalists and the Japanese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese First Offensive (October 25–November 6, 1950) had the limited
      objective of testing U.S.-ROK fighting qualities and slowing their
      advance. In the battle of Onjŏng-Unsan along the Ch’ŏngch’ŏn River, the
      Chinese ruined seven Korean and U.S. regiments—including the only Korean
      regiment to reach the Yalu, cut off in the vastness of the cold northern
      hills near Ch’osan. The Chinese suffered 10,000 casualties, but they were
      convinced that they had found a formula for fighting UNC forces: attack at
      night, cut off routes of supply and withdrawal, ambush counterattacking
      forces, and exploit all forms of concealment and cover. Stunned by the
      suddenness of the Chinese onslaught and almost 8,000 casualties (6,000 of
      them Koreans), the Eighth Army fell back to the south bank of the
      Ch’ŏngch’ŏn and tightened its overextended lines. With a harsh winter
      beginning and supplies in shortage, the pause was wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another matter of concern to the UNC was the appearance of MiG-15 jet
      fighters above North Korea. Flown by Soviet pilots masquerading as Chinese
      and Koreans, the MiGs, in one week’s action (November 1–7), stopped most
      of the daytime raids on North Korea. The U.S. Air Force immediately
      dispatched a crack wing of F-86 Sabre jet interceptors to Japan, and thus
      a two-and-a-half year battle for air superiority was joined. Over the
      course of the war, the F-86s succeeded in allowing the Far East Air Forces
      (FEAF) to conduct offensive air operations anywhere in North Korea, and
      they also protected the Eighth Army from communist air attack. However,
      they were never able to provide perfect protection for B-29s flying
      daylight raids into “MiG Alley,” a corridor in northwestern Korea where
      MiGs based near An-tung, Manchuria (now Dandong, China), fiercely defended
      bridges and dams on the Yalu River.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FEAF also turned its fury on all standing structures that might shield
      the Chinese from the cold; cities and towns all over North Korea went up
      in flames. But the air assault did not halt the buildup for the Chinese
      Second Offensive. This time Peng’s instructions to his army commanders
      stressed the necessity to lure the Americans and “puppet troops” out of
      their defensive positions between the Ch’ŏngch’ŏn and P’yŏngyang, giving
      the impression of weakness and confusion, while Peng would surround their
      forward elements with his much-enlarged force of 420,000 Chinese and North
      Korean regulars. MacArthur, in what may have been his only real military
      mistake of the war, ordered the Eighth Army and X Corps northward into the
      trap on November 24, and from November 25 to December 14 the Chinese
      battered them back to South Korea. Falling upon the U.S. IX Corps and the
      ROK II Corps from the east, Peng’s Thirteenth Army Group opened up a gap
      to the west and almost cut off the I Corps north of the Ch’ŏngch’ŏn. The I
      Corps managed to fight its way through Chinese ambushes back to
      P’yŏngyang. In the eastern sector the Chinese Ninth Army Group sent two
      armies against the 1st Marine Division near the Changjin Reservoir (known
      to the Americans by its Japanese name, Chosin). Under the worst possible
      weather conditions, the marines turned and fought their way south,
      destroying seven Chinese divisions before reaching sanctuary at the port
      of Hŭngnam on December 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the height of the crisis, MacArthur conferred with Walker and Almond,
      and they agreed that their forces would try to establish enclaves in North
      Korea, thus preserving the option of holding the P’yŏngyang-Wŏnsan line.
      In reality, Walker had finally reached the limits of his disgust with
      MacArthur’s meddling and posturing, and he started his men south. By
      December 6 the Eighth Army had destroyed everything it could not carry and
      had taken the road for Seoul. Walker’s initiative may have saved his army,
      but it also meant that much of the rest of the war would be fought as a
      UNC effort to recapture ground surrendered with little effort in December
      1950. Walker himself died in a traffic accident just north of Seoul on
      December 23 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartened by the ease with which the CPVF had driven the UNC out of North
      Korea, Mao Zedong expanded his war aims to demand that the Chinese army
      unify all of Korea and drive the Americans and puppets off the peninsula.
      His enthusiasm increased when the Chinese Third Offensive (December 31,
      1950–January 5, 1951) retook Seoul. The Chinese attacks centred on ROKA
      divisions, which were showing signs of defeatism and ineptness. Ridgway,
      therefore, had to rely in the short term upon his U.S. divisions, many of
      which had now gained units from other UN participants. In addition to two
      British Commonwealth brigades, there were units from Turkey, France,
      Belgium, The Netherlands, Greece, Colombia, Thailand, Ethiopia, and the
      Philippines. Pulling his multinational force together, Ridgway pushed back
      to the Han River valley in January 1951. The Chinese, now reinforced by a
      reborn North Korean army, launched their Fourth Offensive on February 11,
      1951. Again the initial attacks struck ill-prepared South Korean
      divisions, and again the UNC gave ground. Again the Eighth Army fought
      back methodically, crossing the 38th parallel after two months. At that
      point Peng began the Fifth Offensive (First Phase) with 11 Chinese armies
      and two North Korean corps. The attacks came at an awkward moment for the
      Eighth Army. On April 11 Truman, having reached the opinion that
      MacArthur’s independence amounted to insubordination, had relieved the
      general of all his commands and recalled him to the United States. The
      change elevated Ridgway to commander in chief, FECOM and UNC, and brought
      Lieutenant General James A. Van Fleet to command the Eighth Army. Like
      Ridgway, Van Fleet had earned wide respect as a division and corps
      commander against the Germans in 1944–45.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Van Fleet could re-form the ROK Army and redeploy his own
      divisions, the Chinese struck. At a low point in Korean military history,
      the battered ROKA II Corps gave way, and U.S. divisions peeled back to
      protect their flanks and rear until Van Fleet could commit five more U.S.
      and Korean divisions and a British brigade to halt the Chinese armies on
      April 28. Mao refused to accept Peng’s report that the CPVF could no
      longer hold the initiative, and he ordered the Second Phase of the
      offensive, which began on May 16 and lasted another bloody week. Once
      again allied air power and heavy artillery stiffened the resistance, and
      once again the UNC crossed the 38th parallel in pursuit of a battered (but
      not beaten) Chinese expeditionary force.
    </p>
    <h3>To the negotiating table</h3>
    <p>
      By June 1951 the Korean War had reached another critical point. The
      Chinese–North Korean armies, despite having suffered some 500,000
      casualties since November, had grown to 1,200,000 soldiers. United Nations
      Command had taken its share of casualties—more than 100,000 since the
      Chinese intervention—but by May 1951 U.S. ground troops numbered 256,000,
      the ROKA 500,000, and other allied contingents 28,000. The U.S. FEAF had
      grown from fewer than 700 aircraft in July 1950 to more than 1,400 in
      February 1951.
    </p>
    <p>
      These developments obliged the leaders of both coalitions to consider that
      peace could not be imposed by either side through military victory—at
      least at acceptable cost. Truman and the UN, in particular, had lost their
      ardour for anything more than a return to status quo ante bellum and were
      sympathetic to the idea of a negotiated settlement. On May 17, 1951, the
      U.S. National Security Council adopted a new policy that committed the
      United States to support a unified, democratic Korea, but not necessarily
      one unified by military action and the overthrow of Kim Il-sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The communist road to a negotiated peace started in Beijing, where Mao,
      who had no desire to end the war, approved an approach suggested by Peng
      and others: hold the ground in Korea and conduct a campaign of attrition,
      attempting to win limited victories against small allied units through
      violent night attacks and infantry infiltration. Protection from UNC
      aircraft and artillery would be provided by caves and bunkers dug into the
      Korean mountains. Meanwhile, negotiations would be managed by the Chinese,
      an unparalleled chance to appear an equal of the United States in Asia and
      a slap at the hated Japanese. The Koreans were not a factor for either
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      After secret meetings between U.S. and Soviet diplomats, the Soviet Union
      announced that it would not block a negotiated settlement to the Korean
      War. The Truman administration had already alerted Ridgway to the prospect
      of truce talks, and on June 30 he issued a public statement that he had
      been authorized to participate in “a meeting to discuss an armistice
      providing for the cessation of hostilities.” On July 2 the Chinese and
      North Koreans issued a joint statement that they would discuss
      arrangements for a meeting, but only at their place of choice: the city of
      Kaesŏng, an ancient Korean capital, once part of the ROK but now occupied
      by the communists at the very edge of the front lines. The Chinese had
      just fired the first salvo of a new war, one in which talking and fighting
      for advantage might someday end the conflict.
    </p>
    <h2>Talking and fighting, 1951–53</h2>
    <h3>Battling for position</h3>
    <p>
      From the time the liaison officers of both coalitions met on July 8, 1951,
      until the armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, the Korean War
      continued as a “stalemate.” This characterization is appropriate in only
      two ways: (1) both sides had given up trying to unify Korea by force; and
      (2) the movement of armies on the ground never again matched the fluidity
      of the war’s first year. Otherwise, the word stalemate has no meaning, for
      the political-geographic stakes in Korea remained high.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the negotiations at Kaesŏng developed, neither Ridgway nor Van Fleet
      believed that the talks would produce anything without more UNC offensives
      beyond the 38th parallel. Ridgway was particularly convinced that UNC
      forces should take the “Iron Triangle,” a key area between the headwaters
      of the Imjin River and the highest eastern mountain ranges that was
      anchored on the cities of Ch’ŏrwŏn (west), P’yŏnggang (north), and Kimhwa
      (east). Communist planners were equally convinced that control of this
      terrain offered advantages for defending North Korea or for continuing the
      war with offensives to the south and east. Ground actions never actually
      ceased in 1951, but none matched the ferocity and frustration of the
      Eighth Army’s Autumn Offensive (August 31–November 12). Van Fleet’s
      general concept envisioned operations by the I Corps (five divisions) in
      the west and the X Corps (five divisions) in the central-eastern sector.
      In the I Corps sector, the ROK 1st Division and the British Commonwealth
      Division made notable advances beyond the Imjin valley, while other U.S.
      and ROK divisions advanced past Ch’ŏrwŏn and then stalled in heavy
      fighting. The X Corps, fighting a crack Chinese army and two North Korean
      corps, pushed northward through the mountains and succeeded only in making
      “Bloody Ridge,” “Heartbreak Ridge,” “The Punchbowl,” and Kanmubong Ridge
      bad memories for thousands of army and marine veterans. The KPA I, III,
      and VI Corps, holding the eastern mountains, proved especially difficult
      to dislodge, for Kim Il-sung had issued a “stand or die” order to his
      much-enlarged and improved armed forces. The most surprising advance
      occurred in the X Corps sector, where two U.S. and two ROK divisions
      pushed the Chinese back 15 km (almost 10 miles) from Kimhwa to Kŭmsong,
      pushing the front line out in a salient that exposed their flanks but also
      establishing a strong position to advance west to P’yŏnggang. The cost of
      the campaign troubled Van Fleet and Ridgway: 60,000 casualties, 22,000 of
      them American.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign did not discourage the Chinese leadership, since in their
      eyes the strategy of “active defense” had worked. The UNC gave up major
      offensive operations in November, and the Chinese actually struck back in
      places with some success. Communist losses of some 100,000–150,000 were
      significant but not crippling—certainly not enough to drive the Chinese to
      end the war, only to talk some more about it. In late October 1951 the
      communists agreed to move the truce negotiations to a more secure area, a
      village named P’anmunjŏm. Within two months they accepted the current line
      of contact between the armies as the military demarcation line; they also
      accepted related measures for the creation of a demilitarized zone (DMZ).
      The UNC accepted that there would be no verification activities outside of
      the DMZ, and both sides agreed to work on a regime for enforcement of the
      armistice after the shooting stopped. Much work on these items remained to
      be done, but the outline of an agreement was becoming apparent as the year
      ended—with one major exception: the handling of prisoners of war.
    </p>
    <h3>Battling over POWs</h3>
    <p>
      As another bitterly cold Korean winter congealed operations on the ground,
      repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs) became the most intractable issue
      at P’anmunjŏm. The initial assumption by the negotiators was that they
      would follow the revised Geneva Convention of 1949, which required any
      “detaining authority” that held POWs to return all of them to their
      homelands as rapidly as possible when a war ended. This “all for all”
      policy of a complete—even forced—exchange of prisoners was certainly
      favoured by the U.S. military, which was alarmed by early reports from
      Korea of atrocities against allied POWs. The South Korean government, on
      the other hand, was adamantly opposed to complete and involuntary
      repatriation, since it knew that thousands of detainees in the South were
      actually South Korean citizens who had been forced to fight with the KPA.
      Indeed, the North Koreans knew that they had much to answer for regarding
      their impressment, murder, and kidnapping of South Koreans. The Chinese
      army leaders, meanwhile, knew that some of their soldiers, impressed from
      the ranks of the Nationalist army, would refuse repatriation if it was not
      made mandatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both sides agreed to exchange the names of POWs and the numbers held in
      various categories. The results of the tally shocked all the participants.
      The U.S. armed forces were carrying 11,500 men as missing in action (MIA),
      but the communists reported only 3,198 Americans in their custody (as well
      as 1,219 other UNC POWs, mostly Britons and Turks). The accounting for the
      South Koreans was even worse: of an estimated 88,000 MIAs, only 7,142
      names were listed. The numbers fed the fears of the allies that the murder
      rate of POWs had been even worse than they suspected. In truth, most of
      the MIAs had died in battle, but perhaps 15,000 (all but 2,000 of them
      South Koreans) had died in communist hands from torture, execution,
      starvation, and medical mistreatment. The communists, too, found little
      comfort in the numbers. Early unofficial estimates of POWs in UNC custody
      had been either too low, around 90,000, or too high, around 170,000. Now
      the official list produced 95,531 North Koreans, 20,700 Chinese, and
      16,243 South Koreans, for a total of 132,474. The UNC reported that the
      40,000 “missing” men were South Koreans who had already passed loyalty
      investigations and would not be counted as potential repatriates. Against
      this background, Truman ruled in January 1952 that no POW in UNC custody
      would be forced to return to North Korea or China against his will.
      Koreans choosing to go north would be exchanged on a “one for one” formula
      until all 12,000 allied POWs had been returned. Such a process, however,
      would require extensive screening of individuals about their preferences,
      a condition that soon created open warfare in the camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The communists had taken steps in 1951 to infiltrate political officers
      into the UNC POW camps, and now orders came from P’yŏngyang to obstruct
      the screening process without regard for loss of life. The goal was to
      make the POWs so obnoxious that the UNC would use force if necessary to
      send every one of them back to communist control. And so, beginning in
      December 1951, a series of revolts broke out “inside the wire,”
      culminating in pitched battles between armed prisoners and entire guard
      battalions in which hundreds of POWs and a small number of UNC troops lost
      their lives. Finally, in May 1952, General Mark W. Clark, who had just
      replaced Ridgway as UNC commander, ordered the execution of Operation
      BREAKUP, which over the following months crushed the revolt with tanks,
      gas, and bullets. By the end of the year, all the Chinese had been sent to
      Cheju Island, repatriate and nonrepatriate POWs segregated, refugees
      resettled, some of the communist intelligence network disrupted, and camp
      administration improved. Vigilantism and gang warfare never ceased
      entirely, however.
    </p>
    <h3>Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
    <p>
      The POW revolt was only one aspect of the “other war” raging behind UNC
      lines. Another was waged by communist partisans and stay-behind units of
      the KPA, who, based in South Korea’s mountainous southern provinces,
      plagued the UNC lines of communication, rear-area camps, and Korean towns.
      In the autumn of 1951 Van Fleet ordered Major General Paik Sun-yup, one of
      the ROKA’s most effective officers, to break the back of guerrilla
      activity. From December 1951 to March 1952, ROK security forces killed
      11,090 partisans and sympathizers and captured 9,916 more—a ratio
      suggesting something close to a “scorched earth, no-quarter” policy.
      Previous ROKA counterguerrilla operations had resulted in the war’s worst
      atrocity by a UNC unit, the execution of 800 to 1,000 villagers at
      Kŏch’ang in February 1951.
    </p>
    <h3>Air Warfare</h3>
    <p>
      Air power gave the UNC its greatest hope to offset Chinese manpower and
      increasing firepower. The FEAF clearly won the battle for air superiority,
      pitting fewer than 100 F-86s against far more numerous Soviet, Chinese,
      and North Korean MiG-15s. Pilots from all the U.S. armed forces downed at
      least 500 MiGs at a loss of 78 F-86s. The Soviets rotated squadrons of
      their air defense force to Korea, losing more than 200 pilots. Strategic
      bombing was at first limited by policy to attacks on North Korean cities
      and military installations—a campaign pursued until P’yŏngyang resembled
      Hiroshima or Tokyo in 1945. In 1952 the bombing of power plants and dams
      along the Yalu was authorized, and the following year approval was given
      to attack dams and supporting irrigation systems in North Korea. The
      bombing caused great suffering for the North Koreans, but they had to
      follow the Chinese and Russians in the war’s strategic direction, and the
      Chinese and Russians were hurt very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the war U.S. political and military leaders studied the
      possible use of nuclear weapons, and upon four separate occasions they
      gave this study serious attention. The answer was always the same:
      existing atomic bombs, carried by modified B-29s, would have little effect
      except for leveling cities. The one time that Truman suggested (in
      December 1950) that he was considering the nuclear option, the British led
      the allied charge to stop such talk. Without question the UNC air campaign
      hurt the communists, and in retaliation the Chinese and North Koreans
      (with Soviet collusion) treated captured pilots with special brutality.
      Air crewmen made up the largest single group of U.S. POWs who truly
      disappeared, presumably dying under interrogation in Manchuria, elsewhere
      in China, and possibly in Russia. The communists also claimed that FEAF
      bombers were spreading epidemic diseases among the civilian population,
      and they tortured captured American pilots until they extracted
      incriminating statements of terror bombing and germ warfare.
    </p>
    <h3>Strengthening the ROK</h3>
    <p>
      U.S. air power might have held the communists at bay in the near term, but
      the long-term security of the ROK depended on (1) the enlargement and
      improvement of its own armed forces and (2) the stability of its
      government. The first requirement was accomplished by the United States’
      Korean Military Advisory Group, which modernized the ROKA and also
      organized an effective training program. In the political arena, however,
      the UNC had to deal with the aging Syngman Rhee, who was convinced that he
      had an unfinished divine mission to save Korea. In 1952 Rhee forced the
      National Assembly to make the election of the president a matter of
      popular vote, immediately calling an election and winning a second term
      with five million of the six million votes cast. Rhee’s political coup had
      a ripple effect that spread to the armistice negotiations, as his dogmatic
      opposition to a cease-fire increased in scope and vigour. Essentially,
      Rhee could not believe that a likely new Republican administration in
      Washington, led by two other venerable Cold Warriors, Dwight D. Eisenhower
      and John Foster Dulles, would be satisfied to have U.S. soldiers “die for
      a tie.” Neither could the Russians, Chinese, and North Koreans.
    </p>
    <h3>The final push</h3>
    <p>
      From September to November 1952, the Chinese expeditionary force staged
      its sixth major offensive of the war, this time to force the allies back
      to the 38th parallel and to inflict unacceptable casualties on them.
      Raging from the valley of the Imjin through the Iron Triangle to the
      eastern mountains, the ground war followed the same dismal pattern. The
      Chinese infiltrated allied outposts at night, then attacked under the
      support of short, intense artillery barrages. Submachine guns and hand
      grenades ruled the trenches, and flamethrowers and demolitions became
      standard weapons for assault units. Obscure hills acquired memorable
      names: White Horse Mountain, Bunker Hill, Old Baldy, Sniper Ridge, Capitol
      Hill, Triangle Hill, Pike’s Peak, Jackson Heights, and Jane Russell Hill.
      By the time fighting faded in mid-November, the Eighth Army had lost
      10,000 men, the Chinese 15,000. Chinese commanders hoped that they had
      persuaded president-elect Eisenhower to abandon any ambitious plans for a
      major offensive in 1953. The Chinese need not have worried, for both
      Eisenhower and secretary of state-designate Dulles viewed continuation of
      the Korean War as incompatible with U.S. national security interests. In
      their view the People’s Republic of China was indeed the enemy in Asia,
      but Korea was only one theatre in the struggle. They also knew that the
      voting public’s support for the war had thinned throughout 1952 as the
      talking and fighting continued abroad and the talking and taxing continued
      at home. As for the negotiations, Dulles conceded the communists’ point
      that voluntary repatriation should involve screening by an international
      agency, not just U.S.-ROK teams. When the UN and the International
      Committee of the Red Cross called for an exchange of sick and disabled
      POWs as a goodwill gesture, Eisenhower approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan proved a good test of communist intentions—by sheer chance. On
      March 5, 1953, Joseph Stalin died, and within weeks the Politburo of the
      Soviet Communist Party voted that the war in Korea should be ended. Mao
      Zedong received the news with dismay, but he knew that his army could not
      continue the war without Soviet assistance. With a speed that amazed the
      negotiating teams on both sides, the Chinese accepted voluntary
      repatriation. POWs who wanted to return to their homelands would be
      released immediately, and those who chose to stay would go into the
      custody of a neutral international agency for noncoercive screening. The
      Chinese and North Koreans also agreed to the exchange of sick and disabled
      POWs, which took place between April 20 and May 3. Peace was not yet at
      hand, however. Rhee had never publicly surrendered his “march north and
      unify” position, and in private he hinted that he might “accept” an
      armistice only in return for serious commitments by the United States,
      including an unambiguous mutual security alliance and $1 billion in
      economic aid. The Chinese, meanwhile, saw but one way to win concessions
      and territory in a peace agreement: on the battlefield. Their seventh and
      final offensive opened in the Imjin River sector in May against U.S. and
      Commonwealth divisions, then shifted to the South Koreans, who were driven
      back 30 km (about 19 miles) from the Kŭmsong salient.
    </p>
    <h3>Armistice</h3>
    <p>
      The battle of the Kŭmsong salient ended the shooting war. On May 25 the
      P’anmunjŏm negotiators had worked out the details of the POW exchange,
      making provisions for “neutral nation” management of the repatriation
      process. They began to plan for an armistice signing. Then, on June 18–19,
      Syngman Rhee arranged for his military police to allow 27,000 Korean
      internees in their custody to “escape.” Enraged, the Chinese ordered
      further attacks on the ROKA. The Americans shared their fury but, in the
      interest of compromise, convinced Rhee that the United States would meet
      all his preconditions for an armistice. On July 9 Rhee agreed to accept
      the armistice, though no representative of the ROK ever signed it. On July
      27 Mark W. Clark for the UNC, Peng Dehuai for the Chinese, and Kim Il-sung
      for the North Koreans signed the agreement. That same day the shooting
      stopped (more or less), and the armies began the awkward process of
      disengagement across what became a 4-km- (2.5-mile-) wide DMZ. Supervision
      of the armistice actions fell to a Military Armistice Commission (10
      officers representing the belligerents), a Neutral Nations Supervisory
      Commission (Sweden, Switzerland, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), and a
      Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (the same four states, plus India
      as the custodian of the POWs). From August 5 to September 6, a total of
      75,823 communist soldiers and civilians (all but 5,640 of them Koreans)
      returned to their most-favoured regime, and 7,862 ROK soldiers, 3,597 U.S.
      servicemen, and 1,377 persons of other nationalities (including some
      civilians) returned to UNC control. The swap became a media event of
      potent possibilities: the communist POWs stripped off their hated
      capitalist prison uniforms and marched off singing party-approved songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handling of those who refused repatriation turned into a nightmare, as
      agents among the communist POWs and interrogators made life miserable for
      the Indians. By the time the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission gave
      up the screening process in February 1954, only 628 Chinese and Koreans
      had changed their minds and gone north, and 21,839 had returned to UNC
      control. Most of the nonrepatriates were eventually settled in South Korea
      and Taiwan. As provided for in the armistice agreement, the United States
      organized an international conference in Geneva for all the belligerents
      to discuss the political future of Korea. The actual meetings produced no
      agreement. The Korean peninsula would continue to be caught in the coils
      of Cold War rivalry, but the survival of the Republic of Korea kept alive
      the hope of civil liberties, democracy, economic development, and eventual
      unification—even if their fulfillment might require another 50 years or
      more.
